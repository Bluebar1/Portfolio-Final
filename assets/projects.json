The filter menu will automatically recalculate the ‘technology used’  statistics and resize the menu. To ensure the performance of the filter menu I asynchronously resize the layout when the user is adjusting their screen size, rather than every time the widget builds. The text animation is done by using an AnimationController to iterate through a LinearGradient of Paint colors. View the full source code on github.",

    "details": "FaceDetection is my Capstone project for my computer science degree. It calculates the accuracy of each algorithm (MTCNN, Haar Cascade, RetinaFace) on a dataset of thousands of photos of masked and unmasked people. Using this data we were able to compare the effectiveness of each algorithm and decipher what made them behave differently. For example, the RetinaFace algorithm focuses on detecting eyes which gave it an advantage over the other algorithms that looked for facial features covered by a mask. The program is written in python and is accessible through command line or a Kivy app. The source code and EXE application download can be found on github.",

I also made the website for the app using HTML/CSS and javascript with features such as an animated carrossel screenshot viewer, and an accordion style help menu.
